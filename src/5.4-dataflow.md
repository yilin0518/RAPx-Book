# Chapter 5.4. Data-flow Analysis
Data-flow analysis tracks value flow in the program including copy, move, ref, and other scenarios. With this module, users can easily have a whole picture of the value flow in any function and query whether there is value dependency between two mir local variables.

This module defines a graph data structure to store the data parsed from Rust mir. The graph nodes are indexed by `Local` which is defined by rustc. The edges between the nodes also define the data dependency relationship.

## Dataflow Analysis Trait

```rust
pub trait DataFlowAnalysis: Analysis {
    // Required methods
    fn get_fn_dataflow(&self, def_id: DefId) -> Option<DataFlowGraph>;
    fn get_all_dataflow(&self) -> DataFlowGraphMap;
    fn has_flow_between(
        &self,
        def_id: DefId,
        local1: Local,
        local2: Local,
    ) -> bool;
    fn collect_equivalent_locals(
        &self,
        def_id: DefId,
        local: Local,
    ) -> HashSet<Local>;
    fn get_fn_arg2ret(&self, def_id: DefId) -> Arg2Ret;
    fn get_all_arg2ret(&self) -> Arg2RetMap;
}
```

## Quick Usage Guide
Developers can test the feature using the following command:
```shell
cargo rapx -dataflow
```

To switch in debug mode and draw the graph with `graphviz`, execute the following command.
```shell
cargo rapx -dataflow=debug
```

To use the feature in your own application, refer the following code.
```rust
let mut dataflow_analysis = DataFlowAnalyzer::new(self.tcx, false);
dataflow_analysis.run();
let dataflow = dataflow_analysis.get_all_arg2ret();
rap_info!("{}", Arg2RetMapWrapper(dataflow));
```

For example, we can apply the value flow analysis to the `dangling_min` case, and the result of function `create_vec` is as follows:
```rust
fn create_vec() -> *mut Vec<i32> {
    let mut v = Vec::new();
 //Fix: let mut v = Box::new(Vec::new());
    v.push(1);
    &mut v as *mut Vec<i32>
 //Fix: Box::into_raw(v)
}
```
<div align="center"><img src="figure/create_vec.png" style="zoom: 80%;"></div>

To utilize the analysis results in other analytical features, developers can use RAPx as follows:
```rust
use analysis::core::dataflow::Dataflow; // import the module
let dataflow = Dataflow::new(tcx); // create a dataflow object
dataflow.build_graphs(); // parse all the functions in tcx and build corresponding graphs
```

### Graph APIs

#### DFS
This function uses precedence traversal. The node operator and edge validator decide how far the traversal can reach with the help of return values. You can also modify outside variables captured by these two closures to record data during the DFS. `traverse_all` decides if a branch finds the target successfully, and whether the traversal will continue or not.

For example, if you need to instantly stop the traversal once finding a certain node, then set `traverse_all` to false.
If you want to traverse all the reachable nodes which are decided by the operator and validator, then set `traverse_all` to true.

```rust
pub fn dfs<F, G>(&self, now: Local, direction: Direction, node_operator: &mut F, edge_validator: &mut G, traverse_all: bool) -> DFSStatus
where 
 F: FnMut(&Graph, Local) -> DFSStatus,
 G: FnMut(&Graph, EdgeIdx) -> DFSStatus,
```

#### is_connected

This function is built upon the `DFS` API. It tries to find `idx_2` from `idx_1`, upside first then downside.

```rust
pub fn is_connected(&self, idx_1: Local, idx_2: Local) -> bool
```
